# Desafio-Ze-Delivery

Hello! First of all thank you so much for letting me try this challenge and learn more about this awesome tool that's GraphQL
The project is organized as following:

ROOT
|
|----app-desafio - Folder where's the entire project
|----|----src
|----|----|----assets
|----|----|----components - Where components that both pages use are, like Footer, Header, etc
|----|----|----css - Where the style.css is
|----|----|----pages
|----|----|----|----Home
|----|----|----|----|----index.js - Home's page
|----|----|----|----Products
|----|----|----|----|----index.js - Home's page
|----|----|----App.js
|----|----|----routes.js - Take care of routes and links between both pages
|----|----public - Where stuff like favicon.ico and index.html are

### **Observations**
There're some observations:
- I tried to create the React app without the command, but I had trouble to set the images, so I used create-react-app (I'm really sorry!)
- I had a problem with Google Maps's API Key while I was writing/testing the code, so, if it happens again, there's a commented part that pass a fixed pair of coordinates.
