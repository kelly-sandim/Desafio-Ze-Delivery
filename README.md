# Desafio-Ze-Delivery

Hello! First of all thank you so much for letting me try this challenge and learn more about this awesome tool that's GraphQL
The project is organized as following:
 <br />
 <br />
ROOT <br />
| <br />
|----app-desafio - Folder where's the entire project <br />
|----|----src <br />
|----|----|----assets <br />
|----|----|----components - Where components that both pages use are, like Footer, Header, etc <br />
|----|----|----css - Where the style.css is <br />
|----|----|----pages <br />
|----|----|----|----Home <br />
|----|----|----|----|----index.js - Home's page <br />
|----|----|----|----Products <br />
|----|----|----|----|----index.js - Home's page <br />
|----|----|----App.js <br />
|----|----|----routes.js - Take care of routes and links between both pages <br />
|----|----public - Where stuff like favicon.ico and index.html are <br />
 <br />
### **Observations**
There're some observations:
- I tried to create the React app without the command, but I had trouble to set the images, so I used create-react-app (I'm really sorry!)
- I had a problem with Google Maps's API Key while I was writing/testing the code, so, if it happens again, there's a commented part that pass a fixed pair of coordinates.
